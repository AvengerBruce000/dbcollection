# dbcollection for Matlab

This is a simple wrapper for the Python's dbcollection module for Matlab. The functionality is almost the same, appart with a few minor differences regarding setting up ranges when fetching data. Internally it uses the Python's dbcollection module for data download/process/management.

I cannot provide any garantees concerning older version.
