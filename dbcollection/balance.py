"""
Balances the data between sets of the dataset.

Allocating/moving data between two or more sets can be done using the balance
property in the load() API. To do this, simply select the name of the sets you
want to balance, and then provide the total amount per set. 

This allows the user to move data around, even depleting a set of data if needed. 
Moving the entire data of a dataset into one set is not only possible but also 
doable and easy.
